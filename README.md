## Sourcery
Instantly review and improve your Python code to keep your codebase maintainable. 

Get started with our CLI to have Sourcery review all your code locally or star this repo to have our GitHub bot review your most popular Python repo

## CLI

You can have Sourcery review your entire project and make dozens or hundreds (or thousands) of improvements with a single command from the command line. 

To start `pip install sourcery`, login with `sourcery login`, and then run `sourcery review <some path>` to have Sourcery review and make suggestions on every file in that path

## CI & Pre-Commit

Keep your entire codebase standardized with Sourcery’s [CI integration](https://docs.sourcery.ai/Guides/Getting-Started/CI/) and [pre-commit hook](https://docs.sourcery.ai/Guides/Getting-Started/Pre-Commit/). 

For CI we recommend using

```yaml
pip install sourcery
# Store your Sourcery token as a secret in your CI environment.
sourcery login --token $SOURCERY_TOKEN
sourcery review --check --diff "git diff main" .
```

Or if it’s easier you can [check out our GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/sourcery-action)!

To set up your pre-commit hooks use:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/sourcery-ai/sourcery
    rev: v1.0.3
    hooks:
      - id: sourcery
        # The best way to use Sourcery in a pre-commit hook:
        # * review only changed lines:
        # * omit the summary
        args: [--diff=git diff HEAD, --no-summary]
```

Note: Sourcery is fully free for open-source projects - but you need a [Team plan](https://docs.sourcery.ai/Product/Plans/) to use Sourcery in CI or as a pre-commit hook for private projects.
